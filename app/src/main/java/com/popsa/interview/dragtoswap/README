Using the Motion events I tried to use the MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE as the scope to call a drag listener to 
show a shadow of the image being moved before the drop event. However, this did not work at all as intended. 

This actually led to inconsistency of which image could be moved. The alternative approach that I tried was simply
to update the image location within the ACTION_MOVE scope but this also led to chopping animation while dragging the 
image and would move outside the screen view.
